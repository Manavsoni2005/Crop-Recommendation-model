# Crop-Recommendation-model
This project recommends the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil and environmental conditions.  
It uses parameters such as **Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall** to suggest the ideal crop.  

## Features
- Analyzes important soil and weather factors  
- Suggests best crop for better productivity  
- Simple and easy to use  
- Helps in sustainable farming decisions  

## Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)  
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code  

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Manavsoni2005/crop-recommendation-model.git
   ```

## Dataset
- File: CROp.csv.xls
- Contains soil nutrient values, weather conditions, and corresponding crop labels
- Dataset used for training and testing ML models

## Workflow
- Load and inspect dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Preprocess and clean data
- Train ML classification models
- Evaluate and compare model performance
- Predict the most suitable crop

## Output
- Predicted crop name best suited for the given soil and climate conditions
- Visualization of feature relationships
- Model accuracy comparison
